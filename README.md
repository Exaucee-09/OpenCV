## License Plate Recognition Overlay using OpenCV

This project demonstrates the process of adding a transparent background text overlay on an image, which displays a license plate number. The main features of this script include:

- Text Overlay: The license plate number "RAH972U" is rendered with a green color over a transparent background box. The box's transparency is adjustable using the alpha parameter.
-Position Calculation: The text is positioned dynamically based on the dimensions of the input image.
- Rectangle Highlight: A green rectangle is drawn around the license plate area to highlight the region of interest.
- Image Processing: The code leverages OpenCV for image manipulation, including drawing shapes, adding text, and applying transparency effects.

This script is ideal for applications such as automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) systems, where visual cues and annotations are added to input images.
